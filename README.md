# AppAlert (Municipalidad App)

AppAlert is a mobile application built with React Native and Expo, designed to streamline communication between citizens and municipal emergency services like the Police, Fire Department, and Civil Defense. Users can register, log in, submit incident notifications, and authorized personnel can view, respond to, and manage the status of these reports.

## Features
